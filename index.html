We plan to implement fluid simulation using two different methods, and then we can compare their visual quality, performance, and ease of implementation.</p> <p>We will first implement fluid simulation based on the Lattice-Boltzmann equations and create a webpage where a user can interact with the simulation. We will then implement a version based on the Navier-Stokes equations, and add that to the webpage. This will let us do a comparative analysis between the methods, and we can summarize the differences in ease of implementation, performance, and visual quality.</p> <p>Our presentation will focus on their technical differences as well as the different applications for which they are suited.</p> <h2>References</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Navier%E2%80%93Stokes_equations" target="_blank">Navier-Stokes</a> </li> <li><a href="https://shahriyarshahrabi.medium.com/gentle-introduction-to-fluid-simulation-for-programmers-and-technical-artists-7c0045c40bac" target="_blank">Simulation Grid</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/threejs/comments/thx35q/water_simulation_in_three_js/" target="_blank">Reddit posts with past projects</a></li> <li><a href="https://github.com/PavelDoGreat/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation" target="_blank">Github for webgl 2D fluid simulation with pretty colors</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.divecae.com/resources/cfd-methods" target="_blank">Types of methods and their uses</a> </li> <li><a href="https://www.fidelisfea.com/post/navier-stokes-vs-lattice-boltzmann-for-cfd-a-comparative-analysis#:~:text=The%20Navier%2DStokes%20equations%20describe,fluid%20particles%20to%20macroscopic%20scales." target="_blank">Comparison of lattice-boltzmann and navier-stokes</a></li> </ul> <h2>Timeline</h2> <table border="1" cellpadding="10" cellspacing="0"> <thead> <tr> <th>Week and Date</th> <th>Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Week 5 (9/24 - 9/26)</strong></td> <td>Set up project and research equations/algorithms</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Week 6 (10/1 - 10/3)</strong></td> <td>Present Overview, Finish setup for project and make plan for implementation details</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Week 7 (10/8 - 10/10)</strong></td> <td>Start coding Lattice-Boltzmann fluid sim</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Week 8 (10/17)</strong></td> <td>Finish coding Lattice-Boltzmann fluid sim and test on webpage</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Week 9 (10/22 - 10/24)</strong></td> <td>Start coding Navier-Stokes fluid sim</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Week 10 (10/29 - 10/31)</strong></td> <td>Present Progress (10 min)</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Week 11 (11/5 - 11/7)</strong></td> <td>Continue coding Navier-Stokes fluid sim</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Week 12 (11/12 - 11/14)</strong></td> <td>Finish coding Navier-Stokes fluid sim</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Week 13 (11/19 - 11/21)</strong></td> <td>Analysis and writeup for webpage</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Week 14 (11/26)</strong></td> <td>Final Presentation (10 min), Analysis and writeup for webpage</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Week 15 (12/3 - 12/5)</strong></td> <td>Present Final, Make presentation and present</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>We suspect from our research that Navier-Stokes will take us longer to code, so we will try to start and finish Lattice-Boltzmann as early as possible (week 6 if we can finish the setup and research early enough). If we end up having more time towards the end, we will add tools to manipulate the fluid sims.</p> </body></html>
